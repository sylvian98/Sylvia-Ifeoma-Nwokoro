            <p>
              While working at Honey, I developed website design concepts
              focused on enhancing existing features while maintaining the
              current page elements. To validate the designs, I built them in
              WordPress using Local by WP Engine, allowing the team to see how
              the concepts would translate in development.

            <h3>Weetabix</h3>
            <h4><b>Learn More Page</b></h4>
            <p>
              While working at a design and brand agency called Honey, I was
              responsible for maintaining and updating the Weetabix websites.
              Honey manages a total of 21 sites, with Weetabix.com serving as
              the main international site where users can select their preferred
              language.
              <br /><br />The client requested a Learn More page featuring a
              pop-up linking to three different pages on the international site.
              Using ACF, PHP, HTML, SCSS, and JavaScript, I built a custom page
              template that allows users to select their spoken language from a
              dropdown and choose which page to navigate to. The pop-up also
              includes a close button, ensuring a smooth user experience if the
              wrong language is selected.

              Blue Safari, a dynamic clothing brand, aimed to revolutionise
              adventure fashion by seamlessly blending style and functionality.
              To bring this vision to life, we developed a comprehensive UX
              design plan using Figma. <br /><br />

              Since the company had a limited product range, we opted for a
              single landing page to showcase all available clothing. This
              approach ensured a clean and streamlined experience while keeping
              navigation simple. The client preferred a minimalist design with
              fewer pages, focusing on easy product discovery and a seamless
              purchasing process.

              At Hadean, I managed website maintenance, updated templates and
              themes, and developed new design plans for web pages. Working in
              WordPress, I used ACF, PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build
